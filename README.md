<h2>TEXTBOOK CHALLENGE</h2>

and per-hour rate charged for the Job.
b. Include overloaded extraction and insertion operators that get and display a Job’s values.
c. Include overloaded + and – operators that return integers that indicate the total time for
two Jobs, and indicate the difference in time between two Jobs, respectively.
